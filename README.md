# AMQP 1.0 support for RabbitMQ

This plugin adds AMQP 1.0 support to RabbitMQ.

# Status

This is a prototype.  You can send and receive messages between 0-9-1
or 0-8 clients and 1.0 clients (all those 1.0 clients that there
are), with broadly the same semantics as you would get with 0-9-1.

# Building and configuring

The plugin uses the standard RabbitMQ plugin build environment; see <http://www.rabbitmq.com/plugin-development.html>.
