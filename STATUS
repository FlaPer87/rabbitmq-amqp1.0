What works
==========

Simple publishing and consuming.

You can publish to:

* /exchange/<Name> (and set the subject as routing key)
* /queue (and set the subject as queue name)
* /queue/<Name>

You can consume from:

* /exchange/<Name>/<Key>
* /queue/<Name>


What is known not to work
=========================

* sasl-mechanisms frame is not sent
* Multiple-section messages
* amqp-sequence messages (maybe)
* delivery-annotations, message-annotations and application-properties
* lots of header / footer stuff will just be dropped or wrong
* Much in the way of error recovery is missing
* mixed snd_settle_mode
* Probably lots around unusual combinations of settlement and outcomes
* Session window is quite flaky
* virtual hosts other than "/" don't work
* TLS
* Probably lots of other things
