What works
==========

Simple publishing and consuming.

You can publish to:

* /exchange/<Name>/<Key>
* /exchange/<Name> (and set the subject as routing key)
* /queue (and set the subject as queue name)
* /queue/<Name>

You can consume from:

* /exchange/<Name>/<Pattern>
* /queue/<Name>

What is known to work
=====================

* Message fragmentation
    Incoming messages may be split across multiple transfer frames, though the frame size limit is not enforced
    Outgoing messages will be split across multiple transfer frames, honouring the frame size limit
* Errors
    Many connection and link errors will be reported to the connected party

What is known not to work
=========================

* sasl-mechanisms frame is not sent
* Multiple-section messages
* amqp-sequence messages (maybe)
* delivery-annotations, message-annotations and application-properties
* lots of header / footer stuff will just be dropped or wrong
* Much in the way of error recovery is missing
* Probably lots around unusual combinations of settlement and outcomes
* Session window is quite flaky
* virtual hosts other than "/" don't work
* transactions
* link recovery
* TLS
* Probably lots of other things

* Transfer:
    sender-settle-mode of unsettled and mixed are treated as the same
    the settled         flag is ignored / settlement mode can only be selected when attaching a link
    the rcv-settle-mode flag is ignored
    the aborted         flag is ignored
